## Introduction

My project is a web application that allows users like you to manage your manga collection. It includes both a front end, which you interact with in your web browser, and a back end, which handles data storage, retrieval, and processing.

Front End:
The front end is what you see and interact with when you visit my website. It's built using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've used a framework like React.js to make it user-friendly. On the front end, you can log in, view your manga collection, add new manga, update existing entries, delete manga you no longer want, and manage your profile.

Back End:
My back end handles requests from the front end, interacts with the database to store and retrieve data, and performs any necessary business logic. It's built using Node.js and Express.js, and it communicates with a MongoDB database to store user accounts and manga details.

## Features

1. User Registration and Authentication:

   --Users can sign up for an account by providing their email address, username, and password.
   --Authentication mechanisms ensure secure access to user accounts, protecting sensitive information.

2. Manga Collection Management:

   --Users can create and manage their personal manga collections.
   --Existing entries can be edited or deleted as needed.

3. Profile Management:

   --Users have the ability to update their profile information, such as name, email address, and password.
   --Profile management features provide a personalized experience and allow users to keep their information up to date.

4. Responsive User Interface:

   --The user interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
   --Responsive design ensures that users can access and manage their manga collections from desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

5. Error Handling and Validation:

   --The application includes robust error handling and validation mechanisms to prevent and handle errors gracefully.
   --Input validation ensures that users provide valid information when creating or updating manga entries and profiles.

6. Security Features:

   --Security measures such as encryption and secure authentication protocols (e.g., JWT) are implemented to protect user data and ensure confidentiality.
   --Measures are taken to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

7. Feedback and Notifications:

   --Users receive feedback and notifications for actions such as successfully adding or updating manga entries.
   --Notification mechanisms inform users of important events and keep them informed about changes to their manga collections or profiles.
